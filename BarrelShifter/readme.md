# 8-bit Bi-Directional Barrel Shifter
This project implements an Multi Bit barrel shifter in Verilog, capable of shifting data logically left or right in a circular manner. The design is fully verified with testbenches in ModelSim. I have initally given Word depth as 8 but it can changed as per need.Useful for DSP applications
